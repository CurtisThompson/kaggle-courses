## Human-Centered Design For AI

Human-centered design (HCD) involves designing systems that serve people's needs. There are several steps to consider:

1. Understand people's needs
2. Ask whether AI is the simplest way to solve those needs
3. Consider harms that AI could cause
4. Prototype with non-AI systems first
5. Provide ways for people to challenge the system
6. Build in safety measures

To mitigate harms you should try to include humans in the different processes of developing the AI. For example, humans can check the data quality before a new build or review AI decisions before they are implemented in the real world.

There are several different ways that people can challenge an AI system. Can certain features be turned off? Can people reach out to the development teams? Is there an explanation of how the AI reached a decision?
